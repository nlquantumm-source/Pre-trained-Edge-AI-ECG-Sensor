# IBM-Granite-ECG-Sensor
IBM Granite use-case for denoising &amp; high accuracy purposes.<br />
Current ECG sensors perform low accuracy especially when patients are at respiration state (The process by which organisms produce energy from food), physical movement, and electrode contact issues (wrong placement which often happens).<br />
IBM Granite models brings a solution here. They are great when placing edge deployment with Synthetic noise application. For ECG Sensor deployment, we decided to use IBM Granite TSPulse (granite-timeseries-tspulse-r1).<br />
TSPulse is one of the best AI model for this use-case because it is pretrained with *dual-space masked recontruction* (time + frequency domains), making it naturally strong at imputation and denoising especially on physiological signals.<br />
Use the *hybrid-dualhead-512-p8-r1* variant for imputation/denoising. It excels at zero-shot reconstruction and works perfectly with fine-tuning.<br />
Use *Google Colab* when training AI model.<br />
Real-time Arduino integration: 512-1024 samples and send data via Serial/WiFi.<br /><br /><br />
# Synthetic Noise Application
*Gaussian white noise* (for powerline/thermal interference).<br />
*Baseline Wander* (low-frequency drift via sine square waves).<br />
*EMG/muscle artifacts* (high-frequency modulated Gaussian) to train the TSPulse model on noisy-clean ECG pairs.<br /><br /><br />
